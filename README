Currently, it supports taking values for graph by array as was requested, as people don't like using .csv files to store the values(As its not convenient for all purposes).
It doesn't support labeling or interaction yet. It will be included in next version.

New class of color called MIMColor has been added, so that user can create their color using values in range(0,1) as well as (0,255),
Unlike UIColor where you have to use range(0,1),

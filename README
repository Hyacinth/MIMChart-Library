This is a project (Opensource library)of chart libraries which can used in iPhone/iPads.
Charts available:
1.Pie Chart
2.Line Graph
3.Wall Graph
4.Bar Graph (Simple, Grouped, Stacked)
5.Fragmented Pie Chart


--------------------------------------------------------------
Beta Version 1.3
--------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, it supports taking values for graph by array as was requested, 
as people don't like using .csv files to store the values(As its not convenient for all purposes).

New class of color called MIMColor has been added, so that user can create their color using values in range(0,1) as well as (0,255),
Unlike UIColor where you have to use range(0,1),


Complete GUIde can be found HERE:
Under Construction, for now use the sample code.
Note: This post might be obsolete for PieCharts.
